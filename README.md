# Real-or-Movie-Quote-Guessing-Game
This project is a one page website which is driven by Ajax / JSON to gather a quote through an API. This data is manipulated through javascript to make a game where users need to guess if a quote is from a Real World person or from a Movie Scene.

This is my first ever self developed JavaScript heavy web page and it came out without any glitches. One more step towards becoming an expert web developer.

Instructions
After you hit begin you have to choose:
1. Famous - if you think the quote was said by someone famous.
2. Movie - if you think the quote is out of a movie scene.

At that point you can end the game by clicking "Finish" or click "Next" to have another question. You can only end the game once the answer to a question is given. Hitting "Home" in the Navbar will reset the page. Clicking Finish will give you your final score in the instructions and information section. You can also see a running score listed up the top.
