### Introduction  
This project is a one page website which is driven by Ajax / JSON to gather a quote through an API. This data is manipulated through javascript to make a game where users need to guess if a quote is from a Real World person or from a Movie Scene.

This is my first ever self developed JavaScript heavy web page and it came out without any glitches. One more milestone towards becoming an expert web developer.

### Instructions
After you hit begin you have to choose:
1. Famous - if you think the quote was said by someone famous.
2. Movie - if you think the quote is out of a movie scene.  
  
At that point you can end the game by clicking "Finish" or click "Next" to have another question. You can only end the game once the answer to a question is given. Hitting "Home" in the Navbar will reset the page. Clicking Finish will give you your final score in the instructions and information section. You can also see a running score listed up the top.  
  
### The Code / Tools used:    
1. HTML5 & CSS3 / Bootstrap.
2. JavaScript ES5 / jQuery for Ajax and on page ready only.
   
### Versions  
1.0 - fairly polished first release. There is a list of additions to make at a latter date to improve the user experience.
